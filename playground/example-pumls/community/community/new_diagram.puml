**[#2196F3] <color:#BBDEFB><&comment-square> Contention: The Treaty of Versailles and the London Ultimatum were the key causes of hyperinflation in Germany.
***[#4CAF50] <color:#C8E6C9><&check> Reason: Reparations and territorial losses significantly increased Germany's financial burden.
****[#8BC34A] <color:#DCEDC8><&zoom-in> Evidence: The Treaty imposed severe economic restrictions that Germany's economy could not withstand.
****[#3F51B5] <color:#C5CAE9><&info> Fact: The London Ultimatum of 1921 set the reparation price at 132 billion gold marks.
****[#795548] <color:#D7CCC8><&audio> Implication: Germany defaulted after one payment, highlighting the unrealistic demands placed on them.
***[#4CAF50] <color:#C8E6C9><&check> Reason: The Treaty of Versailles was more significant than WW1 in causing hyperinflation.
****[#8BC34A] <color:#DCEDC8><&zoom-in> Evidence: WW1 caused failures like inadequate government revenue sources, but inflation remained limited during the war.
****[#3F51B5] <color:#C5CAE9><&info> Fact: The Treaty marked a turning point, imposing strict reparations that worsened the economic situation post-WW1.
****[#E91E63] <color:#F8BBD0><&cloud> Assumption: Post-war reparations would not have led to hyperinflation without the harsh conditions set by the Treaty.
***[#4CAF50] <color:#C8E6C9><&check> Reason: The Treaty facilitated the severity of the Ruhr Occupation and Havenstein's policies.
****[#8BC34A] <color:#DCEDC8><&zoom-in> Evidence: The Treaty allowed France and Belgium to occupy areas of Germany if reparations werenâ€™t paid.
****[#795548] <color:#D7CCC8><&audio> Implication: The crisis in the Ruhr led to further economic destabilization, including printing more money to pay workers.
***[#F44336] <color:#FFCDD2><&x> Objection: Other factors such as Havenstein's policies and WW1 are equally responsible for hyperinflation.
****[#FF9800] <color:#FFE0B2><&zoom-out> Counter Evidence: The policies of Havenstein were a reaction to the reparations imposed by the Treaty, and WW1 inflation remained limited compared to 1922-23.
****[#E91E63] <color:#F8BBD0><&cloud> Assumption: The hyperinflation in 1922-23 would not have occurred without the extreme financial pressures from the Treaty.
